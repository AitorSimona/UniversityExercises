So, What I've done is basically follow the tutorial, Art track.
Place environment props, use proBuilder to create a cone, using many of its tools. 
Added basic point and spot lights, as well as rotating the directional light to
create nighttime. Emissives modified in the skyscrapers and added an additional emissive
to the cone. Added several more objects to the scene. Also created an umbrella using proBuilder,
check ProBuilderMade object in the scene (the last object).
