I've been working with cinemachine, ended up doing a camera transitions handler and a composition of 
cameras to follow a character, based on the distance to the camera to switch from close to far,
front camera pressing Q and up camera when character is rotated upwards. You can go to the Camera
game object and play with the weight values of CinemachineMixingCamera script, some may not change
due to them being controlled by Camera Transitions cript, move and rotate Robot Kyle game object
to see results. Cinemachine blends between the different cameras according to my indications.
