I've been working with cinemachine, ended up doing a camera transitions handler and a composition of 
cameras to follow a character, based on the distance to the camera to switch from close to far,
front camera pressing Q and up camera when character is rotated upwards. Move around 
and watch Camera object inspecotr to see results. 
Cinemachine blends between the different cameras according to my indications.
